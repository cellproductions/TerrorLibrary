TODO:
* Container needs all mouse input controls added
* Label needs all mouse input controls added
* LabelExtended needs all mouse input controls added
* Slider needs all mouse input controls added
* update Slider so that it uses the 'changed' variable

* all input first needs to check if the control is enabled (direct input, meaning mouse click or key press)
* set change variables where appropriate

* Cursor needs to have a setPointerPosition(int x, int y) that sets, on its image, a spot where it gets its x and y positions from

* GUI needs enabled variable
* upon being de-enabled, GUIControls should draw grey, transparent filter over their graphics
* every GUIControl needs alpha variable (upon being changed, set changed to true and set all appropriate Images to that alpha)
* split every GUIControl's checks to draw the graphic (check alpha first, then check visibility)

* add Exception classes
* make numItems in any GUIControl private and give it a getter function

* ListBox's need to fix the length of text if it goes outside the width of the list box
* Click anywhere on a closed ListBoxDrop to open it
* text box's should allow typing sentences outside of the box area, also left + right buttons should move a 'positioner' of sorts to let you type anywhere

BUGS:
* sliders dont set the slider at the right position from the constructor
* clicking on an Item in a ListBox gets gradually more offset for some reason
* ListBox numDown is 1 off when using scrollDown/Up compared to normal click scrolling (perhaps make click scroll use scrollDown/Up functions)
