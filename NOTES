TODO:

ButtonToggle:
* set 'index' to protected, remove oldIndex, make sure setIndex() throws an exception


Container:
* Container needs all mouse input controls added
* fix widths to account for scroll bar (or horizontal scrolling?)
* Make a ContainerGen class that inherits Container, Container stores images, ContainerGen stores images and generic objects


Label:
* Label needs all mouse input controls added
* Labels could do auto line wrapping
* Labels could also centre the text (centreText function)
* should draw text starting from x=0, y=0


LabelExtended:
* LabelExtended needs all mouse input controls added


Slider:
* Slider needs all mouse input controls added
* update Slider so that it uses the 'changed' variable


ListBox:
* ListBox's need to fix the length of text if it goes outside the width of the list box


ListBoxDrop:
* Click anywhere on a closed ListBoxDrop to open it


TextBox:
* text box's should allow typing sentences outside of the box area, also left + right buttons should move a 'positioner' of sorts to let you type anywhere


GUIControls:
* all input first needs to check if the control is enabled (direct input, meaning mouse click or key press)
* set change variables where appropriate
* upon being de-enabled, GUIControls should draw grey, transparent filter over their graphics
* every GUIControl needs alpha variable (upon being changed, set changed to true and set all appropriate Images to that alpha)
* split every GUIControl's checks to draw the graphic (check alpha first, then check visibility)
* make numItems in any GUIControl private and give it a getter function
* instead of using new Color(), create pre made colors in GUIManager
* add constant for font height to be used in all GUIControls
* make owningGUI protected
* should draw outside of the size of the owningGUI
* remove the GUILoop function, its is basically the same as the game loop, not needed


GUI:
* GUI needs enabled variable
* add Exception classes


* Cursor needs to have a setPointerPosition(int x, int y) that sets, on its image, a spot where it gets its x and y positions from
* implement debugging for all GUI/GUIControls (draws a yellow rectangle around them, 0, 0, width - 1, height - 1)
* check exception handling throughout gui stuff
* make sure that all GUI and GUIControls can handle using an image


BUGS:
* sliders dont set the slider at the right position from the constructor
* clicking on an Item in a ListBox gets gradually more offset for some reason
* ListBox numDown is 1 off when using scrollDown/Up compared to normal click scrolling (perhaps make click scroll use scrollDown/Up functions)
